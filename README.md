SMART HEATING CONTROL AND ANALYTICS OF INTEGRATED OIL AND SOLID FUEL HEATING SYSTEM

Student Name:	Sheamus Clifford	Student ID:	02794331
Description:
For my computer systems and networks assignment I intend to implement a smart heating control system which will also record relevant data to a MySQL database for further analysis in order to optimise heating control.
The heating system itself will consist of a traditional oil-fired boiler and a wood fired gasification boiler. My intention is measure and control the relevant influencing factors and to control the heating function and switching between oil and gasification systems. A description of how wood gasification works can be found at the following link. http://www.greenheat.ie/products/boilers/wood-gasification-boilers/
Aside from being able to control the system over a network my primary focus is the real time data I wish to obtain from the system while in operation. I want to employ industry 4.0 principles for my project, in particular:
•	Data being edge driven
•	Report by exception
•	Data interpreted and analysed in a meaningful way and results fed back into the system to form a closed loop in order to optimise and control it based on complete system influencing factors.
Tools, Technologies, and Equipment:
During the implementation of my project I propose to use the following:
•	Arduino Uno control boards x 2
•	Raspberry Pi with Sense Hat
•	LCD display panel
•	Thermocouple temperature sensors x 2
•	4 x PT100 temperature sensors using I2C communication
•	Push buttons for control
•	MQTT Publish and Subscribe
•	http protocol for commands
•	MySQL to store data
•	Python and C++ coding for Raspberry Pi and Arduinos
